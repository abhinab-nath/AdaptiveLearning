I want you to build a complete working MVP adaptive-learning website. Follow these instructions exactly and generate all code, files, folder structure, backend, and frontend.

🔷 PROJECT GOAL

Build a very simple GenAI-powered adaptive learning web app for Indian rural schools.
Only an MVP — small, fast, and minimal.

🔷 FEATURES TO IMPLEMENT (MUST-HAVE)
1) Student Flow

Create these screens:

Screen 1 — Select Grade & Chapter

Student chooses grade: 6, 7, or 8

Student chooses one chapter (e.g., “Fractions”)

Screen 2 — Download Content

When chapter is selected:

Download a small offline content bundle:

Short text paragraph

1 sample image

1 sample audio file

Save this data to IndexedDB for offline use

Screen 3 — Lesson Screen

Display the stored text

Show the stored image

Add a button to play the audio file

Screen 4 — Practice Quiz

Show 2–3 practice questions

Store student answers offline in IndexedDB

Screen 5 — Summary Screen

Show:

Correct answers

Wrong answers

Total score %

🔷 2) Simple Adaptive Learning (AI Logic)

Use Hugging Face Inference API to generate:

If student gets a question wrong:

A short remedial explanation

A hint

If student gets a question right:

One slightly harder follow-up question

Only this small logic is needed to show “adaptive learning.”

🔷 3) Sync Feature (Minimal)

Create a backend with Node.js + Express with one endpoint:

POST /sync

It should:

Accept student score JSON

Save to a simple local JSON file (scores.json)

Return dashboard data like:

{
  "grade6Fractions": [
    { "student": "Student 1", "score": 70 },
    { "student": "Student 2", "score": 40 }
  ]
}

FRONTEND REQUIREMENT:

When internet is available:

Automatically send the score to /sync

Clear local progress after sync

🔷 4) Teacher Dashboard

Create a single HTML page:

Grade 6 → Fractions
Student 1: 70%
Student 2: 40%


Load data from /sync response.

🔷 TECH REQUIREMENTS

Frontend: HTML + CSS + Vanilla JS (or React if easier)

Offline Storage: IndexedDB

Backend: Node.js + Express

AI: Hugging Face Inference API (text generation)

Audio: any small sample file

Image: any placeholder image

Structure: Clean folder structure

❌ WHAT NOT TO BUILD (IMPORTANT)

Do NOT include:

Full NCERT mapping

Multi-language support

Parent portal

Teacher AI planner

Peer learning

Large content library

Deep offline sync system

Multiple grades/chapters

Voice input or TTS

All these are future scope, not part of the MVP.

🔷 FINAL DELIVERABLES

Generate:

✓ Full folder structure
✓ All files with complete code
✓ Working backend
✓ Working frontend
✓ IndexedDB logic
✓ Hugging Face API calls
✓ Syncing implementation
✓ Static teacher dashboard
✓ Instructions to run the project in Replit

Make sure the app runs locally without errors.

✅ End of Prompt — Build the Complete MVP.
